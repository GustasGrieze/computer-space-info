### Vilnius University Linux Bash task.

File and directory sizes need to be converted to a human-readable format (kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes) and the output numbers would be between 0.1 and 1024 with the appropriate unit of measurement, e.g. at location 742656 B - 725 K.

The list of files must be formatted (each entry on a new line, sizes written in a format that is easy for a person to understand, clear columns).

If the free space is exceeded - warn the user and inform how much space needs to be freed up.

Display the top 100 files and directories.

Search for the largest files and directories recursively.
